# SceneShot
A simple but effective way to screenshot the scene view in Unity.


Simply add the 'SceneShot' folder anywhere in your assets, and use the new 'SceneShot' menu items to configure and take screenshots.


'SceneShot -> Take Quick Screenshot' will take a screenshot from the scene view with the current settings.

'SceneShot -> Configure Screenshot' will allow you to configure settings for your screenshot, including resolution and quality.
